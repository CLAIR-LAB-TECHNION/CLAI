## Setup

You can run this code on your own machine or on Google Colab.

1. **Local option:** If you choose to run locally, you will need to install some Python packages.
2. **Colab:** The first few sections of the notebook will install all required dependencies. You can try out the Colab option by clicking the badge below:

We highly recommend running this tutorial on Colab as it will save you a lot of time and effort in dealing with the setup for the notebook.
