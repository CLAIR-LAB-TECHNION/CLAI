        "In reinforcement learning, **value-based methods** are crucial for estimating the value of states and actions, helping agents make optimal decisions. This tutorial covers key concepts in value-based methods, focusing on **Tabular Q-Learning**. Value functions, including the state-value function $V(s)$ and action-value function $Q(s, a)$, represent the expected return of states and actions, guiding the agent towards the optimal policy $\\pi^*$. Tabular Q-Learning, a foundational algorithm, uses a Q-table to store Q-values for state-action pairs, updating them through temporal difference learning to find the optimal action-value function $Q^*(s, a)$. Key topics include Bellman equations, temporal difference learning, the Q-Learning algorithm, and balancing exploration and exploitation.\n"

        "In this tutorial, we delved into several key concepts and methodologies fundamental to value-based reinforcement learning. Our journey began with an exploration of value functions, the backbone of understanding the expected return from states and actions under a given policy. We then introduced the Bellman equations, which provide a recursive decomposition of value functions and are pivotal for various RL algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "We moved on to Temporal Difference (TD) learning, a powerful approach that combines the ideas of Monte Carlo methods and dynamic programming to update value estimates based on observed rewards. This method serves as the foundation for many RL algorithms, including the widely used Q-learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Value iteration was also discussed as a method for computing optimal policies by iteratively improving value function estimates. We examined how this process converges to the optimal value function, providing a robust way to solve Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we focused on Q-learning, a model-free, off-policy algorithm that updates Q-values using the Bellman optimality equation. This method allows agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment, balancing exploration and exploitation to improve decision-making over time.\n",
