        "Imitation Learning (IL) is a technique for learning a policy from demonstrations produced by an \"expert\" (in most cases, a human). There are several types of imitation learning methods, but the simplest approach is called Behavior Cloning (BC). In BC, we attempt to learn a classifier (or regressor if actions are continuous) where the feature space $\\mathcal{X}$ is some representation of the state and the label set $\\mathcal{Y}$ is the set of actions. The expert provides a \"correct\" action for a sample set of states by running in the environment and recording the actions taken at each state. This data is used to learn a classifier that predicts what action the expert would have taken at each state.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we present the BC method and implement an example on the [gym taxi environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/taxi/). Our expert will be an A* algorithm with an admissible heuristic (ensuring optimality). We will then learn from the collected expert data using a multi-layer perceptron neural network, implemented in pytorch.\n",

A possible configuration is any combination of taxi location, passenger location (including \"in_taxi\" indication), and the destination location. In our example the domain map is 5x5 grid, the passenger and destination can be one of 4 possible locations, and the passenger can be either in the taxi or at the initial destination, adding up to a total of $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4 = 500$ states. This makes this simplified taxi environment learnable via deterministic planning and state-value function estimation algorithms. However, for our purposes, we use the model 'under the hood' for simulation. While we acknowledge the model, we focus on using its notations to collect data using an expert policy, rather than directly employing the model framework for planning.\n"

The working assumption is that if $\\pi_{\\text{expert}} \\sim \\pi$ then $D_{\\pi_{\\text{expert}}} \\sim D_{\\pi}$. The idea is to perform behavior cloning, deploy the policy to collect more data, and then have an expert annotate the observations with the correct action. The new data is added to the old data and the process starts over. The most glaring issue with this technique is the need for a human annotator, which can be very expensive or simply unsafe.

        "IL, and specifically BC, is a simple solution to solving basic RL problems. Although it is not perfect, it can achieve some impressive results in expectation. However, we notice two massive issues that manage to cripple even as simple a domain as single-taxi.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our learner is unable to generalize to unseen states and so one mistake can lead to complete failure. A straight forward solution is to collect more data. Due to the small number of states, we will most likely collect optimal actions for all possible states if we collect enough trajectories. Our deep classifier is able to completely fit the training data, and so in this case our classifier correctly chooses the optimal action (as would the expert) at every state.\n",
        "\n",
        "The above solution is only relevant for a simple domain such as this, and is not feasible in much larger state spaces or continuous spaces, in which our algorithms must be able to generalize to unseen observations if they are to be useful. In such cases, it is worth considering other approaches. (For example, A* can be practical if you have a very informative heuristic, but it may fail on large domains without one).\n",

        "\n",
        "The limitations of imitation learning highlight the need for methods that can autonomously collect data and improve policies without extensive human involvement. In future lectures, we will explore reinforcement learning (RL) techniques that address these challenges by allowing agents to learn from their own experiences, aiming for behaviors that surpass human performance."
