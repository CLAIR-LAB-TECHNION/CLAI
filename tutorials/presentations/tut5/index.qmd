## Key Concepts

## RL Process Example


![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/RL_process_game.jpg)


## RL Process - code example

``` {.python code-line-numbers="2-3|6|7|9-10"} 
import gymnasium as gym
env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
observation, info = env.reset()

for _ in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # agent policy that uses the observation and info
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

    if terminated or truncated:
        observation, info = env.reset()

env.close()
```


## Observations/States Space

::: incremental
-   State $s$: is a complete description of the state of the world (there is no hidden information). In a fully observed environment.
-   Observation $o$: is a partial description of the state. In a partially observed environment.
:::
 

## Observations/States Space

There is a differentiation to make between observation and state:

![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/mario.jpg){.absolute top="200" right="80" width="450"}



## States Space - code example

The state space of the CartPole-v1 environment is represented by a 4-dimensional vector:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import gymnasium as gym
env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")

print("The State Space is: ", env.observation_space)
print("Sample observation", env.observation_space.sample()) # Get a random observation
```


## Action Space

Different environments allow different kinds of actions.

::: incremental
-   Discrete action spaces, where only a finite number of moves are available to the agent.
-  Continuous spaces, where actions are real-valued vectors.

:::

## Action Space - code example

The action space is discrete, consisting of two possible actions:

```{python}
#| echo: true
print("The State Space is: ", env.action_space)
print("Sample observation", env.action_space.sample()) # Get a randoma action
```



## Markov Property in RL

The Markov Property implies that our agent needs only the current state to decide what action to take and not the history of all the states and actions they took before.

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}

P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t, s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, \dots, s_0, a_0) = P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)

\end{align*}
```

## Trajectories

A trajectory $\tau$ is a sequence of states and actions in the world,

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}

\tau = (s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \ldots)

\end{align*}
```

Trajectories are also frequently called episodes or rollouts.

## Trajectories - code example

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
num_steps = 10 
trajectory = []
state, _ = env.reset()
# Sample trajectory
for _ in range(num_steps):
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # Sample a random action
    next_state, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    trajectory.append((state, action, reward, next_state))  # Store the transition
    state = next_state  # Update the state
    if terminated or truncated:
        break  # Apply the action to the environment
# Print the trajectory
for t, transition in enumerate(trajectory):
    state, action, reward, next_state = transition
    print(f"Step {t}: State: {state}, Action: {action}, Reward: {reward}, Next State: {next_state}")
```


 
## Policies

A policy is a rule used by an agent to decide what actions to take.

In deep RL, we deal with parameterized policies: policies whose outputs are computable functions that depend on a set of parameters (eg the weights and biases of a neural network) which we can adjust to change the behavior via some optimization algorithm.

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
a_t \sim \pi(\cdot | s_t)
\end{align*}
```

## Policies - code example

```{.python code-line-numbers="1-6|8-12|14-16|17-18|19-20"} 
class Policy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, s_size, a_size, h_size):
        super(Policy, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(s_size, h_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(h_size, a_size)
        self.log_std = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(a_size))  # Log standard deviation

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        mu = self.fc2(x)
        std = torch.exp(self.log_std)  # Standard deviation
        return mu, std

policy = Policy(s_size, a_size, h_size)
# Forward pass through the policy to get mean and standard deviation of action distribution
mu, std = policy(state.unsqueeze(0))  # add batch dimension
m = Normal(mu, std)
action = m.sample()
# Calculate the log probability of the sampled action
log_prob = m.log_prob(action).sum(dim=-1)
```



## Reward and Return

The reward function R is critically important in reinforcement learning. It depends on the current state of the world, the action just taken, and the next state of the world:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}

r_t = R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})

\end{align*}
```

The reward is fundamental in RL because it’s the only feedback for the agent. Thanks to it, our agent knows if the action taken was good or not.


## Finite-Horizon Return

Sum of rewards obtained in a fixed window of steps:

![The cumulative reward equals the sum of all rewards in the sequence](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/rewards_1.jpg)


## Infinite-Horizon Return

Sum of all rewards ever obtained by the agent, but discounted by how far off in the future they’re obtained:

![Discounted expected cumulative reward](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/rewards_4.jpg)



## The Discount Factor

The discount factor $\gamma \in (0,1)$ is both intuitively appealing and mathematically convenient.

- On an intuitive level: cash now is better than cash later. 

- Mathematically: an infinite-horizon sum of rewards may not converge to a finite value, and is hard to deal with in equations. But with a discount factor and under reasonable conditions, the infinite sum converges.


## The RL Problem

The goal in RL is to select a policy which maximizes expected return when the agent acts according to it.

Let’s suppose that both the environment transitions and the policy are stochastic. In this case, the probability of a T -step trajectory is:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}

P(\tau|\pi) = \rho_0 (s_0) \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) \pi(a_t | s_t)

\end{align*}
```

## The RL Problem
The expected return (for whichever measure), denoted by $J(\pi)$, is then:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}

J(\pi) = \int_{\tau} P(\tau|\pi) R(\tau) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim \pi}[R(\tau)]

\end{align*}
```

## The RL Problem

The central optimization problem in RL can then be expressed by

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}

\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} J(\pi)

\end{align*}
```

with $\pi^*$ being the optimal policy.


## Episodic task

In this case, we have a starting point and an ending point (a terminal state). This creates an episode: a list of States, Actions, Rewards, and new States.

![Beginning of a new episode.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/mario.jpg)




## Continuing tasks

These are tasks that continue forever (no terminal state). In this case, the agent must learn how to choose the best actions and simultaneously interact with the environment.

## The Anatomy of a RL Algorithm

## A Taxonomy of RL Algorithms

![A non-exhaustive, but useful taxonomy of algorithms in modern RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/_images/rl_algorithms_9_15.svg)


## Model-Free vs Model-Based RL

- One of the most important branching points in an RL algorithm is the question of whether the agent has access to (or learns) a model of the environment.
  
- By a model of the environment, we mean a function which predicts state transitions and rewards.

- Algorithms which use a model are called model-based methods, and those that don’t are called model-free.
 
## Model-Based RL


![](https://www.kukuxiaai.com/images/blog/reinforcement_learning/CS285/introduction_to_rl_8.png)


## Model-Based RL - Improve the Policy

Pure Planning:
  
  - The most basic approach never explicitly represents the policy, and instead, uses pure planning techniques

  

## Model-Based RL - Improve the Policy

Expert Iteration: 
  
  - A straightforward follow-on to pure planning involves using and learning an explicit representation of the policy, $\pi_{\theta}(a|s)$.
  
  - The agent uses a planning algorithm (like Monte Carlo Tree Search) in the model, generating candidate actions for the plan by sampling from its current policy. 

  - The planning algorithm produces an action which is better than what the policy alone would have produced, hence it is an “expert” relative to the policy.



## Model-Based RL - Improve the Policy

Data Augmentation for Model-Free Methods:

  - Augment real experiences and use a model-free RL algorithm to train a policy.

  

## Model-Free - Policy Based


![](images/pg.png)


## Model-Free - Value Based


![](images/vb.png)


## Exploration/Exploitation Trade-Off

- Exploration is trying random actions in order to find more information about the environment.

- Exploitation is exploiting known information to maximize the reward.

![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/exp_2.jpg)

## Why so many RL algorithms? 

- Different tradeoffs - Sample efficiency, Stability & ease of use

- Different assumptions - Stochastic or deterministic? Continuous or discrete? Episodic or infinite horizon?

- Different things are easy or hard in
different settings - Easier to represent the policy? Easier to represent the model?


## Sample Efficiency

How many samples do we need to get a good policy?

- Off policy: able to improve the policy without generating new samples from that policy

- On policy: each time the policy is changed, even a little bit, we need to generate new samples
